# Trello

Using the Trello API, the following features may be required:

Planning meeting only
  * Create cards
  * Update cards (assign people?, time estimates), or do this in creation

Standup meeting:
  Per person:
  * See how many tasks they still need to complete this sprint.

  * Fetch cards in the board (by developer, by status?)
  * Fetch status of board (how well the sprint is going)
